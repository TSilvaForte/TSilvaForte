- ⚡ Fun fact: Originally, my bachelor degree is Economics. I am also Magister in Finance, that's my background. I started playing around in Programming as amateur, on my own with videos and online courses. Finally I decided to go to the next level and enrolled at a formal Full Stack Developer carreer.. funny right? Here I am!
